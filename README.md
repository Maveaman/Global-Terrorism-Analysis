## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of global terrorism incidents from 1970 to 2017 using the Global Terrorism Database. The goal is to identify terrorism hotspots, uncover behavioral patterns of terrorist groups, and analyze attack types, targets, and economic losses through a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🧱 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing (Python)

The raw dataset contains **181,691 records and 128 columns**. To ensure performance optimization and usability in Power BI, the data was cleaned and transformed into a **star schema model**.

**Key tasks:**

* Data cleaning and missing value treatment
* Mapping coded values to readable labels
* Creating dimension tables (e.g., countries, weapons, targets)
* Exporting structured data as CSVs for Power BI

📁 Tool used: Jupyter Notebook
📊 Output: Cleaned, structured dataset based on a star schema

### 2. Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard is structured across multiple interactive pages for better exploration and storytelling:

#### 📊 **Overview**

* Total terrorist incidents globally
* Top attack types and weapon usage
* Most active groups
* Frequently targeted nations and institutions
* Regional property loss (USD)
* Year-wise trends (1970–2017)
  ✅ *Insight:* 2014 had the highest number of attacks globally

#### 🌍 **Country Insights**

* Most active groups by country
* Total suicide attacks, kidnappings, and property damage
* Heatmap of attacks by state and city
  ✅ *Insight:* Iraq recorded \~23,000 attacks, with \~3,926 in 2014 alone

#### 🧠 **Group Insights**
![global terrorism 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d37437e7-f907-40eb-8f16-408d4ab1f403)


* Operational years and total attacks
* Success rate of attacks
* Use of suicide attacks
* Preferred weapons and methods
* Most targeted institutions
  ✅ *Insight:* ETA operated from 1972 to 2010 with 1650 attacks and an 85.45% success rate, primarily targeting law enforcement using explosives and firearms
